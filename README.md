This Project demonstrates the basics of angular application architecture.  It is simply a responsive wireframe at this point: 
- HTML
- Typescript
- String Interpolation
- Components
- Nested Components
- Property Binding
- Data Binding
- Event Binding
- Directives
- Services
- Dependency Injection

Things to come:
- Routing
- Observables
- Forms Handling
- Pipes
- HTTP Requests
- Authentication
- Route Protection
- Dynamic Components
- Unit Testing (if I'm feeling frisky)
